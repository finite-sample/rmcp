# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.9.1] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed
- **CI**: inline mkcert workflow step still imported the deleted
  `rmcp.transport.http`; replaced with an end-to-end `rmcp serve-http` TLS
  boot + health check. The "Test CLI and MCP protocol" step now drives stdio
  with the official MCP client (the old `rmcp start --quiet` pipe was a no-op
  that masked failures).
- **Stdio test flows**: raw fire-and-close JSON-RPC pipes race the SDK
  server's EOF shutdown and violate the initialization handshake. Scenario
  tests and setup scripts now use the official MCP client
  (`tests/utils.py::run_mcp_stdio_workflow`); removed
  `scripts/testing/test_https_local.py` (superseded by
  `tests/integration/transport/test_https.py`).
- **`read_csv`/`read_excel`/`filter_data` were broken**: their R scripts
  returned row-record data that failed the declared column-wise output
  schemas, and length-1 vectors serialized as JSON scalars instead of arrays.
  All fileops scripts now emit column-wise data with `I()`-preserved arrays.
- **`filter_data` structured conditions never worked**: `fromJSON()`
  simplifies the conditions array to a data.frame and the script iterated
  columns instead of rows; conditions are now normalized to row lists.
- **Deploy**: fail fast with a clear error when the `RMCP_API_KEY` secret is
  missing instead of timing out on the Cloud Run health check.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-19

### Breaking Changes
- **🚨 Protocol layer migrated to the official MCP Python SDK** (`mcp>=1.28`).
  The hand-rolled JSON-RPC transports were removed:
  - stdio now runs on the SDK's stdio transport (`rmcp/transport/sdk.py`)
  - HTTP now serves spec-compliant **Streamable HTTP** at `POST/GET/DELETE /mcp`
    (SDK session manager). The custom `GET /mcp/sse` notification channel and
    the FastAPI landing page/`/docs` endpoints were removed.
  - Clients must send `Accept: application/json, text/event-stream` and complete
    the `initialize` → `notifications/initialized` handshake per spec.
- **🚨 `structuredContent` now conforms to each tool's declared `outputSchema`**:
  it is the raw tool result object rather than the previous
  `{"type": "json", "json": ...}` wrapper. Strict SDK clients that validate
  structured output now work; consumers of the old wrapper must read the
  payload directly.
- **🚨 Remote HTTP binds require authentication by default**: `serve-http`
  refuses non-localhost binds without `--api-key`/`RMCP_API_KEY` unless
  `--allow-unauthenticated` is passed.

### Added
- Bearer-token auth for the `/mcp` endpoint (`--api-key`, repeatable, or
  `RMCP_API_KEY` comma-separated); `/health` remains open; Cloud Run deploy
  injects the key from the `RMCP_API_KEY` GitHub secret
- `resources/templates/list` support (templates no longer leak into
  `resources/list` with brace-URIs)
- SDK adapter (`rmcp/core/sdk_adapter.py`) bridging the existing
  tool/resource/prompt registries to the SDK server, including progress and
  logging notifications via the SDK session

### Fixed
- Static documentation resources (`rmcp://docs/readme`, `rmcp://examples/*`)
  were advertised but unreadable — `rmcp://` reads now fall back to registered
  static resources
- `prompts/get` no longer fails when optional template arguments are omitted
  (missing optional arguments render as "(not specified)")

### Changed
- `fastapi` and `sse-starlette` dropped; Streamable HTTP works with the base
  install (`uvicorn` promoted to a core dependency via the SDK)
- CLAUDE.md/docs/examples updated for Streamable HTTP, auth, and protocol
  `2025-11-25`

## [0.8.1] - 2025-12-27

### Changed

### Fixed

## [0.8.0] - 2025-11-29

### Changed
- MCP protocol version negotiation: server now honors the client-requested
  protocol version when supported (#19) and updated protocol validation and
  defaults to `2025-11-25` with `2025-06-18` back-compat (#17)
- Migrated build backend to `uv_build`; docs theme to furo
- Reorganized documentation; ruff linting across package and tests

### Added
- `httpx` dependency for HTTP client testing

### Fixed
- Docker wheel installation with extras; production image includes HTTP
  dependencies; assorted CI/CD workflow fixes

## [0.7.0] - 2025-10-22

### Breaking Changes
- **🚨 HTTP Endpoint Cleanup**: Removed all backward compatibility endpoints
  - Removed legacy `POST /` endpoint (use `POST /mcp` instead)

  - **Migration**: Update clients to use proper MCP endpoints:
